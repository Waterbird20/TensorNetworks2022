"In this tutorial, we will construct \"full\" density matrix, which is the representation \n",
"of thermal density matrix in the Andersâ€“Schiller (AS) basis.\n",
"## Exercise (a): Complete the function for constructing the full density matrix\n",
"There is a function **getRhoFDM_Ex.m**, which is in the same sub-directory with \n",
"this script. This function is designed to construct the full density matrix. \n",
"The function is incomplete. Complete the parts enclosed by the comments **TODO \n",
"(start)** and **TODO (end)**.\n",

"Also answer the \"Quick Exercise\" appear in the demonstration below.\n",
"## Reduced density matrix at the impurity site\n",
"To verify your implementation, you can run the following script. Below we \n",
"will analyze the reduced density matrix of the local space covering only the \n",
"impurity degress of freedom for different system temperatures.\n",
"\n",
"First, run the iterative diagonalization for the SIAM. Here we use the same \n",
"parameters as those used in the last tutorial.\n",

"Solution to Exercise (a): Complete the function that transforms MPSs into canonical forms\n",
"There is a new function **canonForm.m** under the **Tensor** directory. This function \n",
"uses another new function **Tensor/svdTr.m**, which performs the SVD for tensors \n",
"(not only for matrices) with truncation criteria **Nkeep** and **Skeep**, equivalent \n",
"to the criteria for **canonForm_Ex.m**.\n",
"\n",
"Compare the solution with your implementation of **canonForm_Ex.m**.\n",

"M = canonForm(M,numel(M),[],0); % left-canonical\n",

"First, *transform the right-canonical M to the left-canonical form*, for different \n",
"values of the maximum bond dimension **Nkeep**.\n",

"We see that the norm almost does not change. Why? You can keep track of the \n",
"singular values for each iteration of the transformation. By inserting **disp(diag(S).')** \n",
"directly after the SVD inside the for-loop of **canonForm.m**, you will see that \n",
"the largest singular value is almost unity, and the other singular values are \n",
"much smaller than the largest one. Therefore, the truncation of such small singular \n",
"values and their associated singular vectors barely affects the result.\n",
"\n",
"Then how about to *transform the right-canonical **M** into right-canonical \n",
"form again, with truncating bonds*? \n",
"```Matlab\n",

"```\n",
"The norm decreases exponentially, with decreasing **Nkeep**. Why? In the input \n",
"**M**, all the tensors are already right-normalized; that is, they are equivalent \n",
"to unitary matrices. The singular values of the unitary matrices are unity! \n",
"So the truncation of such singular values result in the loss of information.\n",
"\n",
"Let's consider also the bond-canonical form. The norm also decreases exponentially \n",
"with decreasing **Nkeep**. It is because the right half of the MPS is brought \n",
"*again* into the right-canonical form, with truncating large singular values.\n",

"Exercise (a): Complete the function that transforms MPSs into canonical forms\n",
"There is a function ***canonForm_Ex.m*** which is zipped together with this \n",
"document. The function is designed to transform the input MPS **M** into left-, \n",
"right-, and bond-canonical forms, depending on the index **id** of the target \n",
"bond.\n",
"\n",
"Moreover, one can also set criteria **Nkeep** and **Skeep**, for truncating small \n",
"singular values and the corresponding singular vectors at each SVD. (Note that \n",
"we do not consider degneracies near the truncation threshold in this application, \n",
"in contrast to iterative diagonalization.)\n",
"\n",
"*Read the documentation* of the function for the details of its input and \n",
"output properties.\n",
"\n",
"The main computational parts of **canonForm_Ex** are missing; search for the \n",
"keyword \"TODO\" to identify missing parts. *Complete the function.* You will \n",
"notice that the function is wrapped by **try** ... **catch e** ... **end**, which \n",
"is usefull for debugging.\n",
"\n",
"To test whether the function is correctly implemented, let's consider the \n",
"following example. First, define a random MPS **M**.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"clear\n",
"\n",
"N = 50; % number of sites\n",
"d = 3; % local space dimension\n",
"D = 30; % bond dimension\n",
"\n",
"M = cell(1,N); % MPS; M{n} is the tensor at site n\n",
"\n",
"for itN = (1:N)\n",
"    % assign individual tensors\n",
"    % leg order: left, right, bottom\n",
"    if itN == 1\n",
"    % left end; left leg is of size 1\n",
"        M{itN} = rand(1,D,d);\n",
"    elseif itN == N\n",
"    % right end; right leg is of size 1\n",
"        M{itN} = rand(D,1,d);\n",
"    else\n",
"        M{itN} = rand(D,D,d);\n",
"    end\n",
"end\n",
"```\n",
"Obtain the left-canonical form of **M**. We do not truncate singular values \n",
"and vectors, by setting **Nkeep** = **[]** and **Skeep** = **0**.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"[M_L,S_L] = canonForm_Ex(M,numel(M),[],0);\n",
"S_L\n",
"```\n",
"Since **M** is not normalized from the outset, the norm **S** is not 1; it's actually \n",
"very huge!\n",
"\n",
"We see that the sizes of the leftmost tensors have decreased after bringing \n",
"into the left-canonical form.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"M(1:5)\n",
"M_L(1:5)\n",
"```\n",
"Indeed, in this example, **M(1:3)** were redundantly large, so they could be \n",
"compactified just via the thin SVD.\n",
"\n",
"Compute the overlap between the transformed MPS (with the norm **S** pulled \n",
"out) and the original one. It should be equal to the norm of the MPS.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"Tovl = 1; % overlap\n",
"for itN = (1:N)\n",
"    Tovl = updateLeft(Tovl,2,M{itN},[],[],M_L{itN});\n",
"end\n",
"Tovl/S_L\n",
"```\n",
"We can use **updateLeft** also to \"close the zipper\" from right, after permuting \n",
"the left and right legs of the ket and bra tensors.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"Tovl = 1; % overlap\n",
"for itN = (N:-1:1)\n",
"    Tovl = updateLeft(Tovl,2,permute(M{itN},[2 1 3]), ...\n",
"        [],[],permute(M_L{itN},[2 1 3]));\n",
"end\n",
"Tovl/S_L\n",
"```\n",
"We can further bring **M_L** into the right-canonical form.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"[M_R,S_R] = canonForm_Ex(M_L,0,[],0);\n",
"Tovl = 1; % overlap\n",
"for itN = (1:N)\n",
"    Tovl = updateLeft(Tovl,2,M{itN},[],[],M_R{itN});\n",
"end\n",
"Tovl/S_R\n",
"```\n",
"Now also the right-most tensors are compactified.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"M(end-4:end)\n",
"M_R(end-4:end)\n",
"```\n",
"As the last check, let's consider the bond-canonical form.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"[M_B,S_B] = canonForm_Ex(M,25,[],0);\n",
"Tovl = 1; % overlap\n",
"for itN = (1:N)\n",
"    Tovl = updateLeft(Tovl,2,M{itN},[],[],M_B{itN});\n",
"    if itN == 25\n",
"        Tovl = Tovl*diag(S_B);\n",
"    end\n",
"end\n",
"```\n",
"Here the overlap should equal to the squared norm, since the diagonal matrix \n",
"of singular values is contracted in the middle.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"Tovl/(S_L^2)\n",
"## Exercise (b): Truncate bond dimensions\n",
"*Before solving this Exercise, it is necessary to solve Exercise 1 above, \n",
"since we will use the function **canonForm_Ex.m** that brings the MPS into canonical \n",
"forms.*\n",
"\n",
"In this Exercise, we will compare how the truncation of the bond space affects \n",
"the norm of the MPS, for different canonical forms. Let's generate a random \n",
"MPS again.\n",
"\n",
"clear\n",
"\n",
"N = 50; % number of sites\n",
"d = 3; % local space dimension\n",
"D = 30; % bond dimension\n",
"\n",
"M = cell(1,N); % MPS; M{n} is the tensor at site n\n",
"\n",
"for itN = (1:N)\n",

"        M{itN} = rand(1,D,d);\n",
"    elseif itN == N\n",
"    % right end; right leg is of size 1\n",
"        M{itN} = rand(D,1,d);\n",
"    else\n",
"        M{itN} = rand(D,D,d);\n",

"end\n",

"Make a round trip, by first bringing **M** to the left- and then to the right-canonical \n",

"different values of **Nkeep** < **D** = **30**, while keeping **Skeep** = **0***. How \n",

"In this tutorial, we will compute the impurity contribution to the thermodynamic \n",
"properties of quantum impurity models. The impurity contribution to a thermodynamic \n",
"property means the difference between the value of the thermodynamic property \n",
"of the whole quantum impurity system (which has both the impurity and the bath) \n",
"and that of the bath only. For example, the impurity contribution to the entropy \n",
"is given by $S_\\mathrm{imp} = S_\\mathrm{tot} - S_\\mathrm{bath}$. The subscript \n",
"\"tot\" means the total system that contain both the impurity and the bath, and \n",

"The impurity contributions to spin susceptibility $\\chi_\\mathrm{imp}$, to \n",
"entropy $S_\\mathrm{imp}$, and to specific heat $C_\\mathrm{imp}$ have strong \n",

"which is the universal value. Figure 6 in [<https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0612006 \n",
"P. Coleman, arXiv:cond-mat/0612006>] shows that the Sommerfeld–Wilson ratio \n",

"the ratio is 1. In the Kondo regime of the single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM) \n",
"or the single-impurity Kondo model (SIKM), the ratio is 2.\n",

"There is a function **getTDconv_Ex.m**, which is in the same sub-directory with \n",

"we choose the same parameters as in the last tutorial on the NRG-style iterative \n",

"numerical noise, since the calculation of the impurity contributions to thermodynamic \n",
"properties is sensitive to the noise. The reason for this sensitivity will be \n",
"explained later at the end of this document.\n",
"\n",
"The **doCLD_Ex** function uses numerical integration for determining the positions \n",
"and the coupling strengths of discretized levels in a star geometry. So these \n",
"values of the discretized levels are susceptible to numerical error whose size \n",
"is proportional to the values themselves. The position and the coupling strength \n",
"of the level from the outmost discretization interval is much larger, by many \n",

"can have significant size for the low-energy intervals.\n",
"\n",
"The Lanczos tridiagonalization which follows the numerical integration is \n",
"also susceptible to numerical noise. Especially, the noise is accumulated via \n",

"Sommerfeld–Wilson ratio at such temperatures is given by the ratio between two \n",
"small values, and each small value is given by the subtraction of two large \n",
"values (one for the whole impurity and the other for the bath only). For example, \n",
"**Tchi(end)** and **Tchi2(end)** are $O(0.1)$, but their difference, **Tchi_imp(end)** \n",

"for the value of $J = 8\\Delta_0 D/\\pi U$, considering the same values of $\\Delta_0$ \n",

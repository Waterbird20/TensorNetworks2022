"Solution to Exercise (a): Compute the energy and degeneracy of the many-body ground states\n",
"We introduce a new function **nonIntTB** under under the **Util** directory, which \n",
"computes the ground-state energy and degeneracy as output, taking the hopping \n",
"amplitudes as input. Please read through the function, which is only six lines \n",
"long except for the documentation and comments. You can open the file (i) by \n",
"exploring the \"Current Folder\" window or (ii) by typing the following command \n",
"in the \"Command Window\":\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"edit nonIntTB.m\n",
"```\n",
"If you see an error message that MATLAB cannot find file or directory, please \n",
"re-run **startup.m**. The shortcut on the upper-right corner (which you created \n",
"by following **readme.[pdf,mlx]**) is very convenient in this regard!\n",
"\n",
"The function will be used later during the course. To remind yourself of its \n",
"usage then, you can type the following in the \"Command Window\":\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"help nonIntTB\n",

"The function implements the single-particle Hamiltonian,\n",
"\n",
"$H = \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L-1} -t_\\ell **\\ell+1\\rangle\\!\\langle \\ell ** - t_\\ell^* \n",

"as a matrix,\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"The rows (columns) of the matrix are associated with kets $\\{ **\\ell\\rangle \n",
"\\}$ (bras $\\{\\langle \\ell **\\}$). The first diagonal _below_ the main diagonal \n",
"is filled with $\\{ -t_\\ell \\}$ that represent \"forward\" hoppings, i.e., moving \n",
"to the sites with larger indices, while the first diagonal _above_ the main \n",
"diagonal is with $\\{ -t_\\ell^* \\}$ for \"backward\" hoppings.\n",
"\n",
"After diagonalizing the matrix, a tolerance is set so that its eigenvalues \n",
"(i.e., the single-particle eigen-energies) whose magnitudes are smaller than \n",
"the tolerance are replaced by zeros. The tolerance is defined in terms of double \n",
"precision, using **eps**.\n",
"\n",
"With the function, we can easily solve the sub-exercises by only replacing \n",

"(1) $L = 10$, $t_\\ell = 1$ for all $\\ell$'s:\n",

"Such symmetry is called particle-hole symmetry. Non-interacting tight-binding \n",
"chains are particle-hole symmetric when there are only nearest-neighbor hoppings, \n",
"without on-site energies and long-range hoppings. This statement can be simply \n",
"proven by applying the particle-hole transformation, $\\hat{c}_\\ell \\mapsto (-1)^{\\ell+1} \n",
"\\hat{h}_\\ell^\\dagger$, where $\\hat{h}_\\ell^\\dagger$ creates a \"hole\" at site \n",
"$\\ell$. Then the Hamiltonian becomes\n",

"\\hat{h}_{\\ell+1} ),$$\n",
"\n",
"which is basically identical to the original Hamiltonian, except that it's \n",
"written in $h$'s instead of $c$'s. So the energy eigenvalues of the \"hole\" Hamiltonian \n",
"$\\hat{H} [\\{ \\hat{h}_\\ell, \\hat{h}_\\ell^\\dagger \\}]$ equals to those of the \n",
"original Hamiltonian, indicating that hole excitations have the same energies \n",
"as particle excitations. Note that hole excitations mean emptying out the single-particle \n",
"levels below 0 (that were filled in the ground-state configurations), while \n",

"The values of **E_G** and **d_G** equal to those of the above sub-exercise (2). \n",
"It is because the phase factors in $\\{ t_\\ell \\}$ can be absorbed into the definition \n",
"of the single-particle bases $\\{ ** \\ell \\rangle \\}$. Such absorption is possible \n",
"since hoppings are only between nearest neighbors. In the second quantization \n",

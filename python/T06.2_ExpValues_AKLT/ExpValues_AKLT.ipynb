"Generate the AKLT state\n",
"We will generate the AKLT state on a finite chain of length $L$. The tensor \n",
"at each bulk site (i.e., any site except the left- and rightmost sites) is defined \n",
"as 3-dimensional array, **AKLT**:\n",
"```Matlab\n",

"\n",
"AKLT = zeros(2,2,3);\n",
"local spin S_z = +1\n",
"AKLT(1,2,1) = sqrt(2/3);\n",

"AKLT(1,1,2) = -1/sqrt(3);\n",
"AKLT(2,2,2) = +1/sqrt(3);\n",

"L = 50; % number of sites\n",

"M(:) = {AKLT};\n",
"```\n",
"As we are considering a finite system with open boundary condition, the left- \n",
"and rightmost legs of the MPS should have dimension 1, to represent a single \n",
"global quantum state. Therefore, we project the space of the left leg of **M{1}** \n",
"and the space of the right leg of **M{end}** onto the subspaces of size 1 for \n",
"each leg. Since the left and right legs have dimension 2, there are $4 = 2 \\times \n",
"2$ different global states, which are linearly independent. We'll denote them \n",
"by $** \\psi (\\alpha, \\beta) \\rangle$ with $\\alpha = 1,2$ is chosen for the left \n",
"leg of **M{1}** and $\\beta = 1,2$ for the right leg of **M{end}**. For example, \n",
"we obtain $**\\psi (1,1) \\rangle$ by:\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"M{1} = M{1}(1,:,:);\n",
"M{end} = M{end}(:,1,:);\n",
"```\n",
"Let us check that the bulk tensors are *both left- and right-normalized at \n",
"the same time*.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"% check whether left-normalized\n",
"T = contract(conj(AKLT),3,[1 3],AKLT,3,[1 3]);\n",
"disp(T - eye(size(T))); % all zeros\n",
"check whether right-normalized\n",
"T = contract(AKLT,3,[2 3],conj(AKLT),3,[2 3]);\n",
"disp(T - eye(size(T))); % all zeros\n",
"```\n",
"Note that the bra tensor is obtained as the complex conjugate of the ket tensor, \n",
"via **conj**. Of course, **M{1}** is only right-normalized and **M{end}** is only \n",
"left-normalized, since their left/right legs are projected by boundary condition.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"T = contract(conj(M{1}),3,[1 3],M{1},3,[1 3]);\n",
"disp(T); % not left-normalized\n",

"For computing the expectation values, it is convenient to normalize the MPS. \n",
"(Otherwise, one needs to divide the expectation value with the square of the \n",
"norm of the MPS.) Let's bring the MPS into its left-canonical form, without \n",
"loss of generality.\n",

"[M,Sv] = canonForm(M,numel(M),[],0);\n",
"fprintf('Norm of MPS = %.4g\\n',norm(Sv));\n",

"**M** is normalized.\n",
"## Magnetization\n",
"We can compute the local magnetization as the MPS expectation value of the \n",
"spin-$z$ operator $S_{[n]z}$ acting onto site $n = 10$. The spin-$z$ operator \n",
"can be obtained by using **getLocalSpace**:\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"[S,I] = getLocalSpace('Spin',1);\n",
"Sz = S(:,:,2); % spin-z\n",
"Sz\n",
"```\n",
"Then we contract tensors in a way of \"closing the zipper\", from left to right. \n",
"We initialize the contraction result **T** as **1**. Here the spin-$z$ operator \n",
"is regarded as rank-2. Note that the **updateLeft** function has been slightly \n",
"updated to treat the case **rankC** = **rankX** = 2; see its documentation for details.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"T = 1;\n",
"n = 10; % index of site on which Sz operator acts\n",
"for itN = (1:numel(M))\n",
"    if itN == n\n",
"        T = updateLeft(T,2,M{itN},Sz,2,M{itN});\n",
"    else\n",
"        T = updateLeft(T,2,M{itN},[],[],M{itN});\n",
"    end\n",
"end\n",
"fprintf('Magnetization at site %i = %.4g\\n',n,T);\n",
"## Exercise (a): Magnetization\n",
"In the demonstration above, the code computes the magnetization at only one \n",
"site, by contracting all the tensors from the left end to the right end. However, \n",
"as the MPS was already brought into the left-canonical form, one can start from \n",
"the site $n$, not from the left end. Keeping this in mind, *compute the magnetization \n",
"for all chain sites*. And compare the results with the exact analytic results, \n",
"for all different boundary conditions $\\alpha, \\beta = 1, 2$:\n",
"\n",
"$$\\langle \\psi(\\alpha,\\beta) ** \\hat{S}_{[n]z} ** \\psi(\\alpha,\\beta) \\rangle \n",
"= 2 (-1)^{\\alpha} \\frac{ (-1/3)^{n} - (-1)^{\\alpha+\\beta} (-1/3)^{L - n + 1} \n",
"}{  1 + (-1)^{\\alpha+\\beta}(-1/3)^{L}  }.$$\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"## Exercise (b): Spin-spin correlation\n",
"Compute the correlation function between the spin-$z$ operators at nearest-neighbor \n",
"sites $n$ and $n+1$. Compare this with the exact analytic results:\n",
"\n",
"$$\\langle \\psi (\\alpha,\\beta) ** \\hat{S}_{[n+1]z} \\hat{S}_{[n]z} ** \\psi (\\alpha,\\beta) \n",
"\\rangle = \\frac{(-4/9) - 4 (-1)^{\\alpha+\\beta} (-1/3)^L}{1 + (-1)^{\\alpha+\\beta} \n",
"(-1/3)^L}.$$\n",
"\n",
"Note that the correlation function does not depend on $n$."

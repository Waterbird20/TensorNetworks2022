"Here we will implement the controlled bond expansion (CBE) scheme that can \n",
"improve DMRG or TDVP type of methods. With CBE, one can systematically identifiy \n",
"the relevant subspace of the discarded bond space and append the subspace to \n",
"the kept bond space, expanding the bond space in a controlled way; hence the \n",
"name. Since wider bond spaces can be explored efficiently, the one-site updates \n",
"(DMRG or TDVP type) complemented with CBE may overcome typical weakness of the \n",
"one-site methods, such as inability to adjust bond dimensions and vulnerability \n",
"to local minima. Therefore, one can achieve the accuracy and convergence comparable \n",
"to those of the two-site update, with computational cost comparable with that \n",
"of the one-site update.\n",
"\n",
"The applications of CBE to DMRG ground-state search and TDVP are demonstrated \n",

"These papers demonstrate that the CBE becomes advantageous, especially for the \n",
"systems with large local space dimensions. The CBE scheme is formulated in terms \n",
"of the kept and discarded projectors, introduced in Gleis2022 [<https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13161 \n",

"We explain the basics of MATLAB. The strengths of the MATLAB are\n",
"\n",
"* Intuitive and efficient linear algebra operations.\n",
"* Supports tons of mathematical functions.\n",
"* Platform independent.\n",
"* Many toolboxes (e.g., parallel computing, signal processing, big data, ...)\n",
"* Graphic user interface.\n",
"* Powerful editor, debugger, and profiler.\n",
"* Supports compiler.\n",
"* Last but not least: QSpace, one of the most powerful tensor network libraries \n",
"and used by my group, runs on MATLAB.\n",
"\n",
"You can try out the following commands in three different ways:\n",
"\n",
"(1) First click a section. The selected section will be highlighted with light \n",
"blue borders. Then click \"Live Editor\" (top left), then \"Run Section\" (top right) \n",
"(see a screenshot below). It can be done by shortcut command Ctrl+Enter for \n",
"Windows or Command+Enter for MacOS.\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"(2) Type the commands into the \"Command Window\".\n",
"\n",
"(3) Write a MATLAB script or function (.m file) under the **MyWork** directory. \n",
"You can run it (i) by typing the name of the script or function (only the file \n",
"name, without the **.m** extension) in the \"Command Window\", or (ii) by clicking \n",
"\"Editor\" then \"Run\" (shortcuts: F5 in Windows or Option+Command+R in MacOS) \n",
"(see a screenshot below).\n",
"\n",

"*For this tutorial, there is no exercise problem. Experienced users of MATLAB \n",
"may skip this tutorial, and move on to the next tutorials.*\n",
"## Initialization\n",
"First, clear memory to avoid any possible collision.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"clear % clear memory\n",
"## Basic algebra\n",
"Algebra for numbers. MATLAB basically uses double type variables. In practice, \n",
"this policy helps us to avoid data conversion mistakes (which frequently happen \n",
"in, e.g., C programming).\n",
"\n",
"A = 1; % assign A = 1\n",
"B = 2; % assign B = 2\n",
"A+B\n",
"A-B\n",
"A*B\n",
"A/B\n",
"```\n",
"Also there are some predefined constants.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"i % imaginary number \\sqrt{-1}\n",
"1i % the same\n",
"pi % pi\n",
"```\n",
"e is not a predefined constant.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"e % doesn't work\n",
"```\n",
"When a live in a section contains an error, as here, subsequent lives are \n",
"not executed. Therefore, fix the error (here: comment it out) to be able to \n",
"proceed.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"exp(1) % Euler constant\n",
"```\n",
"For unusual calculations, MATLAB also supports **Inf** (infinity) and **NaN** \n",
"(not-a-number).\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"1/0 % + infinity\n",
"-1/0 % - infinity\n",
"0/0 % not-a-number\n",
"```\n",
"To suppress displaying result, put **;** at the end of command.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"A = 1; B = 2;\n",
"C = A+B  % substitute to C\n",
"C = A+B; % suppress displaying result by putting ';' to the end\n",
"## Numerical precision\n",
"Most of numeric variables in MATLAB have so-called double precision, unless \n",
"specified. It means that the numbers beyond 16 digits to the right of the leading \n",
"significant number are rounded. A simple example to see this is:\n",
"\n",
"clear\n",
"sqrt(2)^2 - 2\n",
"```\n",
"Analytically, $(\\sqrt{2})^2 - 2$ should be strictly zero, but in numerics, \n",
"the digits below $\\sim 10^{-16}$ were rounded at each of **sqrt** and **^2**, hence \n",
"finite value $\\sim 10^{-16}$. Thus in most of numerical methods, such small \n",
"numbers are _de facto_ zeros. Of course, the precision is relative to the magnitude \n",
"of numbers. To see the precision for a numeric variable, you can use the **eps** \n",
"command.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"eps(2)\n",
"eps(1e10)\n",
"eps([1 1e3 1e5])\n",
"## Vectors and matrices\n",

"A = eye(3,3,3) % doesn't work\n",
"```\n",
"You can also define the matrix of **NaN**'s and **Inf**'s.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"A = nan(2,3)\n",
"A = inf(2,3)\n",
"## Matrix operations, element-wise operations\n",
"In MATLAB, matrix operations are intuitive (and efficient).\n",
"\n",

"A*B % matrix multiplication\n",
"B*A % doesn't work\n",
"A+B % doesn't work\n",
"A-B % doesn't work\n",
"```\n",
"The reason why the last three commands fail is that **A** and **B** have different \n",
"sizes. But they do work if **B** and **A** have the same dimensions.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"B = rand(3,2)\n",
"A+B\n",

"C = A/B;\n",
"C*B-A % output will be 0, up to double precision\n",
"## Size commands\n",

"A = rand(3,2)+1i*rand(3,2) \n",
"A' % Hermitian conjugate\n",
"A.' % transpose\n",
"(1i)' % complex conjugate for a number\n",
"## Logical variables and operations\n",
"In addition to double type and character type (shortly mentioned in the cell \n",

"```\n",
"Logical variables also can consitute an array.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"true(3,3)\n",
"```\n",
"The array of logical variables is useful in various operations. For example, \n",
"we can extract the subvector or submatrix whose elements satisfy certain condition, \n",
"e.g., being larger than 0.5.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"A = rand(1,6)\n",
"B = (A > 0.5) % logical vector\n",
"A(B) % only the elements of A larger than 0.5\n",
"C = find(B) % indices of B which is true\n",

"A(C) % the same as A(B), but A(B) is faster\n",
"## Accessing the elements and submatrices of matrices\n",
"We can access the elements and submatrices as follows. Note that the indexing \n",

"The position indexing (using integer indices) and the logical indexing can \n",
"be combined.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"A(1:2,ok) % combine position and logical indexing\n",

"A(3:4,:) = 200 % substitute to two columns by the uniform value 200\n",
"A(2:4,4:end) = 2 % substitute to a submatrix by the uniform value 2\n",
"A(:) = 0 % substitute all the elements by 0\n",
"```\n",
"In addition to indexing as (row index, column index), linear indexing is also \n",
"available. The linear index is 1 for the upper left corner elements. Then the \n",

"Note that, simiarly to **eig** function without **'vector'** option, the shape \n",
"of **S** differs depending on how we request the output of **svd**. Contrary to \n",

"## Save and load\n",
"One can save the variables into .mat file, which is the MATLAB format of saving \n",
"numerical data, with **save** function.\n",
"\n",
"clear % clear variables\n",
"A = rand(3,4);\n",
"save('test.mat','A') % creates test.mat in the current working directory\n",
"```\n",
"Beware of wrapping the names of file and variables with **' '**, to treat them \n",
"as char array. When variable names are not specified, **save** function saves \n",
"all the variables in the workspace. Also, you can specify the absolute path \n",
"of the .mat file.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"whos('-file','test.mat') % data in 'test.mat'\n",
"```\n",
"To add variables, set **'-append'** option.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"B = rand(1,2);\n",
"save('test.mat','B','-append')\n",
"whos('-file','test.mat')\n",
"```\n",
"If variables of size larger than 2GB need to be saved, then use **'-v7.3'** \n",
"option.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"save('test.mat','-v7.3')\n",
"```\n",
"On the other hand, one can load the variables from .mat files.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"clear\n",
"load('test.mat') % load all variable\n",
"whos\n",
"clearload('test.mat','A') % load A only\n",
"whos\n",
"## Other functionalities\n",
"MATLAB provides *much more* functionalities beyond what we have explained \n",
"above. To explore them, use the MATLAB documentation. You can see the documentation \n",
"page of e.g., eig, by (i) typing in the command window:\n",
"\n",
"help svd\n",
"```\n",
"or by (ii) select a text **eig** in the command window or the editor window \n",
"and press F1. Of course, as MATLAB is very popular tool, there are many useful \n",
"websites, blogs, books, forums, etc. If you have any question, simply search \n",
"it from internet!"

"## Tensor network representation of the partition function of the classical Ising model\n",
"We revisit the example of the classical Ising model on a square lattice, to \n",
"verify our implementation of TRG and GILT-TNR.\n",
"\n",
"In a previous tutorial on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group \n",
"(CTMRG), we constructed a PEPS $**\\psi (\\beta) \\rangle$ that expresses the thermal \n",
"ensemble of the classical Ising model; for example, the squared norm $\\langle \n",
"\\psi (\\beta) ** \\psi (\\beta) \\rangle$ is the partition function. The PEPS has \n",
"a one-site unit cell, represented by a rank-5 tensor, whose legs are all of \n",
"dimension 2. Then for the computation of the partition function (or equivalently, \n",
"free energy), the rank-5 tensor is contracted to its conjugate to build a reduced \n",
"tensor, which is rank-4 and has legs of dimension 4.\n",
"\n",
"Actually, if we are interested only in the partition function, we can have \n",
"a more compact representation of the reduced tensor. Let's consider a 2-by-2 \n",
"matrix sitting on a bond between two sites $m$ and $n$, whose elements are given \n",
"by the Boltzmann weights with respect to the nearest-neighbor interaction between \n",
"$m$ and $n$:\n",
"\n",
"$$W_{\\sigma_m \\sigma_n} = \\exp \\left[\\beta (-1)^{\\sigma_m + \\sigma_n} \\right] \n",
".$$\n",
"\n",
"Here $\\sigma = 1 (2)$ is the index for spin-up (down) state, respectively. \n",
"Then the $W$ matrix, which is Hermitian, can be decomposed into $M M^\\dagger$, \n",
"where $M$ is a 2-by-2 matrix with elements\n",
"\n",

"\\beta}.$$\n",
"\n",
"Then we contract four $M$'s (each of which correponds to an edge attached \n",
"to a lattice site) with a tensor whose elements are defined by a Kronecker delta, \n",

"representation.\n",
"\n",
"On the other hand, for lower temperatures ($\\beta > \\beta_c$), the system \n",
"is in a symmetry-broken phase with two possible configurations. One configuration \n",
"has spin-up magnetization and the other has spin-down. Each configuration has \n",
"a PEPS representation (again) with singleton dimensions. The two singular values \n",
"at the last coarse-graining step of GILT-TNR for $\\beta > \\beta_c$ counts the \n",
"two configurations.\n",
"\n",
"Meanwhile, the bare TRG cannot eliminate short-range features, that remain \n",
"as sub-leading singular values.\n",
"\n",
"Note that, in the CTMRG, the sub-leading singular values are kept since the \n",
"corner and transfer tensors are coarse-grained only towards the outside; their \n",
"legs towards the unit cell should know about the short-range features."

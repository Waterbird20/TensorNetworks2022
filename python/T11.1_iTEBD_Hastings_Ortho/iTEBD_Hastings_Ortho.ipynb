"Author: <https://cqm.snu.ac.kr Seung-Sup Lee>\n",
"\n",
"In this tutorial, we will practice two approaches that overcome the limitations \n",
"of Vidal's original formulation of the iTEBD method.\n",
"\n",
"1.  The first is Hastings' version of iTEBD, proposed in [<https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3149556 \n",
"M. Hastings, J. Math. Phys. *50*, 095207 (2009)>], which avoids the division \n",
"by small singular values. It will be implemented as Exercise (a).\n",
"2. The second is the orthonormalization of an inifinite MPS in the $\\Gamma$-$\\Lambda$ \n",
"notation, developed by [<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.78.155117 \n",
"R. Orus and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. B *78*, 155117 (2008)>]. It will be implemented \n",
"as Exercise (b) and used to obtain the scaling behavior of a spin-spin correlation \n",
"function in Exercise (c).\n",
"## Exercise (a): Complete the function for Hastings' version of iTEBD\n",
"There is a function **iTEBD_GS_Hastings_Ex.m**, which is in the same sub-directory \n",
"with this script. It is incomplete. Complete the parts enclosed by the comments \n",
"**TODO (start)** and **TODO (end)**.\n",
"\n",
"You can check your implementation of **iTEBD_GS_Hastings_Ex.m** by running the \n",
"calculation of the spin-1 Heisenberg model on the infinite spin chain. Here \n",
"we only modify the names of tensors, from **Gamma** to **As**.\n",

"\\hat{S}_{\\ell,z} \\hat{S}_{\\ell+n,z} \\rangle$ for the spin-1 Heisenberg model \n",
"on the infinite spin chain. The scaling behavior of the correlation function \n",
"for large distance $n$ can be identified by analyzing transfer operators, as \n",
"we discussed in the lecture on translationally invariant MPS. The transfer operators, \n",
"however, need to be constructed from the orthonormalized tensors, since the \n",
"scaling analysis rely on the left- or right-normalization of the tensors. Therefore, \n",
"here we obtain the orthonormalized tensors by applying **ortho_Orus_Ex.m** to \n",
"the result from Vidal's iTEBD. (You can also use Hastings' version as well, \n",
"but the current implementation of **ortho_Orus_Ex.m** is based on the $\\Gamma$-$\\Lambda$ \n",

"(ii) Analyze how the correlation length $\\xi$ changes with different **Nkeep**'s. \n",
"(_Hint_: Indeed, $\\xi$ depends on the maximum bond dimension $N_\\mathrm{keep}$ \n",
"(**Nkeep**). In the limit of $N_\\mathrm{keep} \\to \\infty$, it will converge to \n",
"$\\xi \\simeq 6$, as found in [<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.48.3844 \n",

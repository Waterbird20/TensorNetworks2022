"In this tutorial, we will decompose a high-rank tensor into a matrix product \n",
"state (MPS) that consists of rank-2 and -3 tensors, by using the QR decomposition \n",
"or the singular value decomposition (SVD).\n",
"\n",
"Let's define a rank-5 tensor acting onto five subsystems, whose dimensions \n",
"are 2, 3, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"clear\n",
"sz = [2 3 2 3 4]; % local space dimensions\n",
"T = reshape((1:prod(sz)),sz); % rank-5 tensor\n",
"T = T/norm(T(:)); % normalize\n",
"```\n",
"Here **T** is normalized by its norm. Note that, for the computation of the \n",
"norm, it's necessary to take a linearized form of the tensor by using **(:)**.\n",
"\n",
"I will demonstrate the decomposition of the tensor \"from left to right\", i.e., \n",
"decomposing a tensor for the first leg, then for the second, and so on, by using \n",
"the QR decomposition:\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"The numbers next to the tensor legs indicate the order of the legs. A left-unitary \n",
"matrix obtained after the $n$-th QR decomposition are reshaped and stored in \n",
"the $n$-th cell **Q{n}**. At the last iteration (i.e., the fourth iteration), \n",
"we dump the remaining tensor into **Q{5}**. For **Q{1}** and **Q{5}**, we assign the \n",
"dummy legs of dimension 1, indicated by the x symbols at the ends. By introducing \n",
"the dummy legs, we can treat all the tensors **Q{n}** as rank-3, which simplifies \n",
"the code writing.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"Q = cell(1,numel(sz));\n",
"R = T; % temporary tensor to be QR-decomposed\n",
"szl = 1; % the bond dimension of the left leg of Q{n} to be obtained after\n",
"the QR decomposition at iteration n; for n = 1, szl = 1 for the dummy leg\n",
"for it = (1:(numel(sz)-1))\n",
"    R = reshape(R,[szl*sz(it), prod(sz(it+1:end))]);\n",
"    [Q{it},R] = qr(R,0);\n",
"    Q{it} = reshape(Q{it},[szl, sz(it), numel(Q{it})/szl/sz(it)]);\n",
"    Q{it} = permute(Q{it},[1 3 2]); % permute to the left-right-bottom order\n",
"    szl = size(Q{it},2); % update the bond dimension\n",
"    R = reshape(R,[szl,sz(it+1:end)]);\n",
"end\n",
"Q{end} = permute(R,[1 3 2]);\n",
"```\n",
"Note we use the thin QR decomposition by setting the second input argument \n",
"to **qr** as **0**.\n",
"\n",
"Check the dimensions of tensors in the MPS.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"Q\n",
"```\n",
"Note that the MATLAB automatically truncates the trailing singleton dimension, \n",
"so the dummy leg dimension of **Q{5}** is not displayed.\n",
"## Exercise (a): Check the integrity of the tensor decomposition\n",
"Contract the tensors **Q{1}**, ..., **Q{5}** to make a rank-5 tensor again. Check \n",
"whether the contraction result is the same as the original tensor **T**.\n",
"## Exercise (b): Entanglement entropies for different bipartitions\n",
"Compute the entanglement entropy $S_{\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{B}}$ for the following \n",
"three ways of bipartitioning the tensor **T**'s fives legs into two sets, A and \n",
"B:\n",
"\n",
"(i) A = {1, 2}, B = {3, 4, 5};\n",
"\n",
"(ii) A = {1, 3}, B = {2, 4, 5};\n",
"\n",
"(iii) A = {1, 5}, B = {2, 3, 4}.\n",
"## Exercise (c): Use the SVD for the tensor decomposition and compute the entanglement entropy\n",
"Let's consider the same tensor **T** defined above. Apply the series of the \n",
"SVD from left to right to decompose **T** into an MPS, represented by a cell array \n",
"**M**.\n",
"\n",
"1.  At each step $n$ of the SVD, compute the entanglement entropy $S_n = - \\sum_i \n",
"s_i^2 \\log_2 (s_i^2)$ by using the singular values $\\{ s_i \\}$. What are the \n",
"values of $S_n$ for different iterations?\n",
"2. After the SVD, truncate the decomposed components associated with the singular \n",
"values smaller than the double precision accuracy limit **eps**. How do the size \n",
"of tensors **M{n}** differ from the above results **Q{n}**? \n",
"3. Similarly as in Exercise (a), check whether the contraction of **M{n}**'s \n",
"reproduce the original tensor **T**."

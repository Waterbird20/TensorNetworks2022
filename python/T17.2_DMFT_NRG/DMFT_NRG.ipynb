"In this tutorial, we will perform the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations \n",
"by using our NRG code as an impurity solver. Such approach is called DMFT+NRG.\n",
"\n",
"_Note:_ The calculations for Exercises (b) and (c) will take quite long time; \n",
"it took about 50 minutes on my laptop.\n",
"## Exercise (a): Complete the DMFT+NRG function\n",
"There is a function **DMFT_Hubbard_Ex.m**, contained in the same sub-directory \n",
"together with this script. The function is designed to perforem DMFT+NRG calculations \n",
"on the Hubbard model on a lattice whose non-interacting density of states is \n",
"semi-elliptic,\n",
"\n",
"$$\\rho(\\epsilon) = \\frac{2}{\\pi D^2} \\theta (D - **\\epsilon**) \\sqrt{D^2 - \\epsilon^2} \n",
".$$\n",
"\n",
"Here we use $D :=1$ as the energy unit. Such semi-elliptic $\\rho(\\epsilon)$ \n",
"comes from the Bethe lattice with infinite coordination number. However, the \n",
"actual lattice geometry is not important here, since the only information on \n",
"the lattice relevant to this type of calculation is the non-interacting density \n",
"of states.\n",
"\n",
"Complete **DMFT_Hubbard_Ex.m**, by filling out the parts enclosed by the comments \n",
"**TODO (start)** and **TODO (end)**.\n",
"\n",
"Let's consider the simplest example of $U = 0$ and $\\mu = 0$. Actually, this \n",
"example is somehow trivial; the DMFT self-consistency loop completes in two \n",
"iterations regardless of the initial hybridization function. (*Quick exercise:* \n",

"Let's plot the local spectral functions $A (\\omega) = (2/D)^2 \\Delta'' (\\omega)$. \n",
"Note that this relation between $A(\\omega)$ and $\\Delta''(\\omega)$ holds only \n",
"for the semi-elliptic $\\rho(\\epsilon)$ we've chosen.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"cmap = parula(round(size(RhoV2s,2)*1.2));\n",

"Indeed, the converged spectral function equals to the non-interacting density \n",
"of states, i.e., $A(\\omega) = \\rho(\\omega)$. That is, the DMFT is exact for \n",
"non-interacting systems.\n",
"\n",
"In the plot above,  we multiplied $\\pi D/2$ to the spectral functions so that \n",
"the converged curve takes a value of 1 at the Fermi level ($\\omega = 0$); it's \n",
"in the same spirit as we multiplied $\\pi \\Delta_0$ in the previous tutorial \n",
"on the SIAM with a box-shaped hybridization function.\n",
"## Exercise (b): Obtain the DMFT+NRG solutions starting from the $U = 0$ result\n",
"Let's use the $U = 0$ result of the hybridization function as the initial \n",
"hybridization function for DMFT self-consistency loops. Obtain the DMFT+NRG \n",
"solutions of the Hubbard model at half filling (i.e., $\\langle \\hat{n}_i \\rangle \n",
"= 1$), for several different values of $U/D = (2:0.3:3.5)$. Fix $T = 10^{-4} \n",
"D$ and $D := 1$. Plot the converged spectral functions. What's happening? Also, \n",
"discuss the convergence behaviors depending on $U$.\n",
"## Exercise (c): Obtain the DMFT+NRG solutions starting from the $U = 3.5 D$ result\n",
"Obtain the DMFT+NRG solutions for the same system parameters as used in Exercise \n",
"(b), except that we use the $U = 3.5D$ result of the hybridization function, \n",
"one of the results from Exercise (b) above, as the initial hybridization function, \n",
"instead of the $U = 0$ result. How do the converged spectral functions look \n",
"like, in comparison with the results of Exercise (b)?"

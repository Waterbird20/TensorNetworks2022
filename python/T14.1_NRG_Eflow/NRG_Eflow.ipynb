"The numerical renormalization group (NRG) is a tensor network method specialized \n",

"Kenneth G. Wilson> has itnvented NRG to solve the Kondo problem which was not \n",
"solvable then. The invention of NRG, indeed, is a part of his Nobel prize citation. \n",
"NRG is an ancestor of all numerical methods having \"renormalization group\" in \n",

"Note that in this tutorial we use a slightly different convention for indexing \n",
"the Wilson chain parameters (hopping amplitudes, on-site energies), chain sites, \n",
"and iteration indices, compared with the convention used in the lecture note. \n",
"Here, iteration 0 involves only the spaces spanned by the input isometry **A0**; \n",
"iteration 1 also involves the next site from the bath; and so on. That is, iteration \n",
"indices in this convention are larger than those in the lecture note's convention \n",
"by 1.\n",
"\n",
"Once you solve Exercise (a), you can run the following demonstration in which \n",

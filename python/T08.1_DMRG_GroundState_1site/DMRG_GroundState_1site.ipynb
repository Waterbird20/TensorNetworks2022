"exercises. As shown in those exercises, the tight-binding chain show different \n",

"We will implement the single-site DMRG method and compare the DMRG result \n",

"## Exercise (a): Initialize MPS with the iterative diagonalization result\n",
"Before starting the iterative ground state search, we need to specify an MPS \n",

"The error is $O(10^{-6})$. The error can be further decreased by increasing \n",
"bond dimension **Nkeep**. Indeed, the accuracy is bound by finite bond dimension, \n",
"since the system is gapless. Consider a bipartition of the chain, into left \n",
"and right halves. The entanglement between two parts in the ground state increases \n",
"with the system size $L$ logarithmically, for the gapless systems. Thus, to \n",
"achieve the same accuracy, we should use larger bond dimension that increases \n",
"as the power law of $L$.\n",
"\n",
"On the other hand, for the gapped systems, high accuracy can be achieved with \n",

"Here we will implement the 1-site TDVP method for simulating the real-time \n",
"evolution of one-dimensional quantum states.\n",
"## Exercise (a): Complete the function for 1-site TDVP\n",
"There is a function **TDVP_1site_Ex.m**, which is in the same sub-directory \n",
"with this script. It is incomplete. This function is designed to perform the \n",
"real-time evolution of the MPS via the 1-site TDVP method, and to measure the \n",
"expectation values of a local operator (given as input) at every site after \n",

"As described in those papers, the 1-site TDVP algorithm is quite similar to \n",
"the 1-site DMRG for ground-state search. Accordingly, the TDVP takes the Hamiltonian \n",
"in its MPO form. So one may recycle the DMRG code, **DMRG/DMRG_GS_1site.m**. **TDVP_1site_Ex.m** \n",
"contains subfunctions **TDVP_1site_expHA** and **TDVP_1site_expHC** for the Lanczos \n",
"method for local time evolutions. Complete these subfunctions as well, by adapting \n",
"from the Lanczos subfunctions of **DMRG/DMRG_GS_1site.m**.\n",
"\n",
"After completing the **TDVP_1site_Ex.m**, you can consider the following example \n",
"of the XY chain, discussed in the previous tutorial on tDMRG.\n",

"\n",
"However, there is a crucial difference in this 1-site TDVP tutorial. Since \n",
"1-site update methods cannot increase bond dimensions, we need to declare large \n",

"Here we assigned very small but finite coefficients to the spin-down (spin-up) \n",

"were true zeros. Such treatment here is to stabilize the numerics.\n",

"non-square matrix, there can be a problem if the number of \"finite\" singular \n",
"values is smaller than the smaller dimension of the matrix. (Here \"finite\" means \n",
"values that are not true zeros. So numerical precision noise is also regarded \n",
"\"finite\" in this argument.) In such a case, the singular vectors associated \n",
"with truly vanishing singular values are chosen arbitrarily from the null space, \n",
"and such chosen singular vectors can be physically irrelevant. By setting small \n",
"numbers instead of true zeros, this problem can be suppressed.\n",
"\n",
"Those small numbers to not increase the error of the calculation results, \n",

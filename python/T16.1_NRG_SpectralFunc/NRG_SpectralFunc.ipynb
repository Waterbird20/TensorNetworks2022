"We observe several important features.\n",
"\n",
"1.  The system has the spin symmetry (due to the absence of magnetic field) \n",
"and the particle-hole symmetry. So all the curves lie on top of each other.\n",
"2. There are side peaks centered near $\\omega = \\pm U/2$, as marked by vertical \n",
"dash-dotted line. They come from local excitations from singly occupied states \n",
"to the double occupied state for the peak at $\\omega = U/2$ (to the empty state \n",
"for the peak at $\\omega = -U/2$).\n",
"3. The full-width-half-maximum of the \"Kondo peak\" (peak centered at $\\omega \n",
"= 0$) is on the order of $T_\\mathrm{K}$.\n",
"4. There is a plateau for $** \\omega ** \\ll T_\\mathrm{K}$ which corresponds to \n",
"the top of the Kondo peak. The height of the Kondo peak satisfies the Friedel \n",
"sum rule, $\\pi \\Delta_0 A (\\omega = 0) = 1$, up to a few percent error. Note \n",
"that the Friedel sum rule is the exact relation holds at $T = 0$.\n",
"\n",
"The quality of the curve (e.g., frequency resolution) can be improved by using \n",
"so-called $z$-averaging, that is, by mixing the NRG results with the logarithmic \n",
"discretization grid relatively shifted with respect to each other.\n",
"\n",
"Also, the accuracy with respect to the Friedel sum rule can be further improved \n",
"by using more advanced logarithmic discretization schemes (see e.g., [<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.085106 \n",
"R. Zitko and Th. Pruschke, Phys. Rev. B *79*, 085106 (2009)>]) and by using \n",
"the \"self-energy trick\" (see [<https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/10/37/021/meta \n",
"R. Bulla, A. C. Hewson, and Th. Pruschke, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter *10*, 8365 \n",

"## Exercise (b): Temperature dependence of the impurity spectral function\n",
"Compute the impurity spectral function $A[\\hat{d}_\\sigma, \\hat{d}_\\sigma^\\dagger] \n",
"(\\omega)$ for different temperatures. Discuss how the lineshapes change with \n",
"temperatures.\n",
"## Exercise (c): Dynamical susceptibilities\n",
"In the previous tutorial, we computed the impurity contribution to the magnetic \n",
"susceptibility. This property is static, i.e., does not depend on frequency \n",
"$\\omega$ (or energy, equivalently, by setting $\\hbar = 1$). Some experimental \n",
"probes such as neutron scattering can resolve the frequency dependence of the \n",
"spin susceptibility. The frequency dependence encodes interesting information \n",
"of the system.\n",
"\n",
"In this exercise, we will consider the dynamical spin susceptibility at the \n",
"impurity, which is the retarded-time correlation function of spin operators \n",
"$\\hat{S}_{d,z}$. That is, its spectral function, say $\\chi''_s (\\omega)$, is \n",
"obtained by substituting $\\hat{O}_1 = \\hat{O}_2 = \\hat{S}_{d,z}$ to the first \n",
"equations at the top of this document.\n",
"\n",
"Similarly, we also consider the dynamical charge susceptibility at the impurity, \n",
"by choosing $\\hat{O}_1 = \\hat{O}_2 = \\hat{n}_d - \\langle \\hat{n}_d \\rangle$, \n",
"where $\\hat{n}_d = \\hat{n}_{d\\uparrow} + \\hat{n}_{d\\downarrow}$ counts the particles \n",
"of both spins at the impurity. (*Quick exercise:* Why do we use $\\hat{n}_d - \n",
"\\langle \\hat{n}_d \\rangle$, not $\\hat{n}_d$?) We denote the spectral function \n",
"of the charge susceptibility as $\\chi''_c (\\omega)$.\n",
"\n",
"Compute $\\chi''_s (\\omega)$ and $\\chi''_c (\\omega)$ for the SIAM with the \n",
"same choice of parameters as in the above demonstration of the impurity spectral \n",
"function. How do the curves look like? Can you interpret the peak locations \n",
"in the curves?"

"state search.\n",
"## Exercise (a): Complete the two-site DMRG function\n",
"There is a function **DMRG_GS_2site_Ex.m**, which is in the same sub-directory \n",
"with this script. It is incomplete. Complete the parts enclosed by the comments \n",
"**TODO (start)** and **TODO (end)**.\n",
"\n",
"In the two-site update, you can decrease the bond dimensions by discarding \n",
"ingular values smaller than $10^{-8}$ and their corresponding singular vectors \n",
"as the _truncated_ SVD. It is because the decreased bond dimensions can be increased \n",
"back again, if needed, within the two-site update.\n",
"\n",
"On the other hand, in the single-site update, bond dimensions cannot increase; \n",
"so one should use the _thin_ SVD (as opposed to the truncated SVD) that removes \n",
"trivial zero contributions (coming from the mismatch between the row and column \n",
"dimensions) only.\n",
"\n",
"We revisit the XY spin chain to verify the code implementation. Here, we use \n",
"a random MPS as the initial guess for both the single- and two-site updates, \n",
"to compare their performance.\n",

"For most cases, the two-site update better converges to the solution in terms \n",
"of number of sweeps. At each iteration, the bond space between the two tensors \n",
"that are updated is identified by SVD-ing a rank-4 tensor given by the Lanczos \n",
"solution of the effective Hamiltonian. The bond space can be optimized by exploring \n",
"larger space (of dimension $Dd$ in the standard naming convention, or **Nkeep*size(I,2)** \n",
"in this code) and then truncating it. By contrast, in the single-site update, \n",
"the bond spaces are fixed, as they are also spanned by the right and left legs \n",
"of the left and right neighbor tensors (that are fixed in the current iteration), \n",
"respectively.\n",
"\n",
"Of course, the two-site update takes more computational cost than the single-site \n",
"update; see the time lap record above. Therefore, it is desirable to have a \n",
"method having a better convergence behavior as the two-site update while having \n",
"a cheaper computational cost comparable to the single-site update.\n",
"## Exercise (b): Majumdar-Ghosh model\n",

"Compute the ground state of this system by using the two-site update DMRG \n",

"look into the output MPS, you will find a peculiarity of the ground state. Explain \n",
"the peculiarity by plotting the singular values (obtained as the fourth output \n",

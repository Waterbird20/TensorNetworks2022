"Surprisingly, the 2-site TDVP has a larger error at earlier times before the \n",
"runaway time (after which the finite bond dimensions cannot fully capture the \n",
"large entanglement generated along the time evolution). This larger error is \n",
"because that the subspace projected by the global 2-site projector, used in \n",
"the 2-site TDVP, does not only contain the tangent space. So it reveals the \n",
"fact that the 2-site TDVP is not mathematically \"clean\" as the 1-site TDVP.\n",
"\n",
"However, this error is relatively minor, compared to the major sources such \n",
"as the projection error. In this example, such minor error is visible since \n",
"the target state is rather simple; the left-most and right-most parts of the \n",
"states are almost separable, until they meet the wavefront of the magnetization \n",
"fluctuation. So the strength of the 2-site method (i.e., the on-the-fly exploration \n",
"of the bond spaces) does only show up in shorter CPU time spent; the 2-site \n",
"method takes smaller bond dimensions if they are enough to capture the entanglement. \n",
"Moreover, our 1-site TDVP calculations could be stabilized by using some tricks \n",
"in initializing the state; without those tricks, the 1-site TDVP may fail. (*Quick \n",

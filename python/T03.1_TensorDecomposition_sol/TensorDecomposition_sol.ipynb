"Solution to Exercise (a): Check the integrity of the tensor decomposition\n",
"For this solution, I will use the function **contract** (under **Tensor** directory) \n",
"which is introduced as a solution of another tutorial \"Tensor contractions\".\n",
"\n",
"Let's repeat the construction and the decomposition of the same rank-5 tensor \n",
"**T**.\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"clear\n",
"sz = [2 3 2 3 4]; % local space dimensions\n",
"T = reshape((1:prod(sz)),sz); % rank-5 tensor\n",
"T = T/norm(T(:)); % normalize\n",
"\n",

"for it = (1:(numel(sz)-1))\n",
"    R = reshape(R,[szl*sz(it), prod(sz(it+1:end))]);\n",

"Now let's contract the tensors **Q{n}** to make a rank-5 tensor again.\n",
"\n",
"We first remove the first (i.e., left) leg of **Q{1}** which is dummy, either \n",
"by reshaping **Q{1}** or by permuting the first leg to the end. The latter approach \n",
"works since MATLAB automatically suppresses trailing singleton dimensions; such \n",
"permuted leg will not appear explicitly in the array. Also, we want to sort \n",
"the remaining two legs of **Q{1}** in the bottom (physical)-right order. All these \n",
"treatment can be done by a single line of **permute**:\n",
"```Matlab\n",
"T2 = permute(Q{1},[3 2 1]);\n",
"```\n",
"And we contract tensors.\n",

"The maximum difference between their corresponding elements is of order of \n",

"## Solution to Exercise (c): Use the SVD for the tensor decomposition and compute the entanglement entropy\n",
"This process can be implemented in a similar way of using the QR decomposition. \n",
"The differences are that (i) the left-unitary matrices \"**U**\" whose columns are \n",
"left singular vectors are reshaped to be **M{n}**, and that (ii) the entanglement \n",
"entropy is computed.\n",

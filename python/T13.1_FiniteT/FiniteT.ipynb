"In this tutorial, we implement two different approaches for simulating thermal \n",
"states based on imaginary-time evolution.\n",
"\n",
"1.  The *purification* method represents a thermal density matrix as a \"super-vector\" \n",
"that acts on the physical and auxiliary spaces. The purified thermal state undergoes \n",
"imaginary-time evolution by applying Trotter-decomposed time evolution operators. \n",
"In this scheme, the imaginary-time instance, corresponding to the inverse temperature, \n",
"increases linearly.\n",
"2. The *exponential tensor renormalization group (XTRG)*, first developed in \n",
"Chen2018 [<https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031082 B.-B. \n",
"Chen, L. Chen, Z. Chen, W. Li, and A. Weichselbaum, Phy. Rev. X *8*, 031082 \n",
"(2018)>], represents a thermal density matrix as an MPO $\\tilde{\\rho} (\\tau) \n",
"= \\exp (-\\tau \\hat{H})$. By multiplying two MPOs, one gets another MPO representation \n",
"of the thermal state for a half of the temperature: $\\tilde{\\rho}(2\\tau) = \\tilde{\\rho}^\\dagger \n",
"(\\tau) \\tilde{\\rho}(\\tau)$. In other words, the imaginary-time instance increases \n",
"logarithmically; see Fig. 2(a) of Chen2018.\n",
"\n",
"In Exercises (b) and (c), we will complete the purification method and the \n",
"XTRG, respectively, and apply them to compute the partition function of the \n",
"XY spin-1/2 chain,\n",
"\n",
"$$\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{XY}}= -\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L-1} (\\hat{S}_{\\ell,x} \\hat{S}_{\\ell+1,x} \n",
"+ \\hat{S}_{\\ell,y} \\hat{S}_{\\ell+1,y})= -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L-1} (\\hat{S}_{\\ell,+} \n",
"\\hat{S}_{\\ell+1,-} + \\hat{S}_{\\ell,-} \\hat{S}_{\\ell+1,+}) .$$\n",
"\n",
"As we discussed many times in previous tutorials, this model is analytically \n",
"solvable. Especially, the partition function of the system at temperature $T$ \n",
"is given by\n",
"\n",
"$$Z = \\prod_{k = 1}^{L} (1 + e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_k}),$$\n",
"\n",
"where $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature and $\\epsilon_k = - \\cos( k\\pi \n",
"/ (L+1))$ is the single-particle eigen-energies.\n",
"\n",
"For a fair comparison, we choose parameters so that the both approaches reach \n",
"the inverse temperature $\\beta = 100$ in 40 iterations.\n",
"## Exercise (a): Complete the function for variational multiplication of MPOs\n",
"The common part of the two different approaches is MPO multiplication.\n",
"\n",
"1.  At each iteration in the purification method, the MPO representation of \n",
"a time evolution operator $\\exp (-\\Delta \\tau \\hat{H})$ multiplies to the MPO \n",
"representation of the purified thermal state at imaginary time $-\\mathrm{i} \n",
"\\tau$, leading to the purified state at $-\\mathrm{i} (\\tau + \\Delta \\tau)$.\n",
"2. At each iteration in the XTRG, the MPO representations of $\\tilde{\\rho}^\\dagger \n",
"(\\tau)$ and $\\tilde{\\rho} (\\tau)$ are multiplied, leading to $\\tilde{\\rho} (2\\tau)$.\n",
"\n",
"For the MPO multiplication, we use the function **mtimes_MPO_Ex.m**, included \n",
"in the same sub-directory with this script. The function is supposed to perform \n",
"variational multiplication of MPOs, where the multiplication result MPO is optimized \n",
"via two-site update, which is similar to the ground and excited states search \n",
"within the DMRG. See App. D 1 of Chen2018 for the details of the variational \n",
"MPO multiplication.\n",
"\n",
"The function **mtimes_MPO_Ex.m** is incomplete. Complete the parts enclosed \n",
"by the comments **TODO (start)** and **TODO (end)**.\n",
"## Exercise (b): Complete the function for the purification method\n",
"Once you complete **mtimes_MPO_Ex.m**, you can use it as a key sub-routine for \n",
"the purification method, which is partially implemented in **finT_puri.m**, which \n",
"is also included in the same sub-directory. Complete the parts of **finT_puri.m** \n",
"enclosed by the comments **TODO (start)** and **TODO (end)**.\n",
"\n",
"To verify the codes, we compute the partition function of the XY spin chain. \n",
